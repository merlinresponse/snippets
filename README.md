## Tesla invoice extractor
A handy little script to extract a batch of Tesla .zip invoice files, to one folder of extracted files. 
As you will have noticed, the .zip places every pdf into its own folder, which is particularly annoying, as your accounting software will probably not handle folder uploads.
Simply run this Jupyter Notebook in a folder with a zip and results folder (as you will see from the code) and place your downloaded .zip files all into the zip folder. 
Run the script and get all you pdf's in the results folder.

PS: As you will see this is classic Python code so technically you could run it however you want. Jupyter is just handy as you can run it without to much "environment hassle".
